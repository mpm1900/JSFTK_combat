## Welcome to my Turn-based combat game!

There currently is no name, but this game is a work in progress.
It started as a tech demo to keep my React skills shart and turned into something fun.

# Things that I need help with

- Enemy Design (can always use more)
- Weapon Design (mostly done, but uniques still need designing)
- Armor Design
- Boss Design
- Encounter copy writing
- Enemy artwrok (preferably SVG icons)
- More Skill/Ability SVG Icons
- and even more
